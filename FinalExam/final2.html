        <h2>Photography Mediums</h2>
		<h3>Film</h3>
        <p>While pre-dated slightly by a few antiquated technologies, this widely considered to be the original form of photography, and one that is still relevant today after nearly 150 years. There are several formats of film photography that exist including 35mm, 110, 120, and 220, but 35mm is the most used and most familiar to most of us who are not professional photographers. The format of 35mm is used by both professionals and recreational photogs alike and even if unknowingly, it is what countless people have used before when using disposable film cameras. <br>
           This format involves using a physical film strip made of celluloid that is fed through a camera body. When properly fed through, this film acts as a negative which uses the camera body and lens to capture light and preserve within this film negative. This process on its own does not produce the family photos that most of us are familiar with, as it is then necessary to develop this film negative using a chemical process that can be done at home, but is generally handled by sending this to a professional photo processing lab. Once developed, these photographs can either be scanned to use or share digitally or can be printed in a variety of sizes and materials.<br> 
           Even though film stock and camera quality can vary widely, this is largely considered to be one of the highest quality formats to take photographs in or at least has the highest ceiling. Capturing light directly to film without digital compression or interpretation can be one of the most accurate ways to capture a moment with the right equipment. In addition to the fidelity offered by film stock, not having instant access to what your photo will look like can often lead to photographers honing their skills and mastering their equipment by necessity as it is unpleasant to waste film on a poorly captured image. 
         </p>
        <h3>Digital</h3>
        <p>Digital photography is by far the most prominent medium used today as it has proliferated using standalone digital cameras but also being built into non-camera devices that we use daily such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even sometimes game consoles. While there are countless types of digital cameras like point-and-shoot, DSLR, mirrorless, and full-frame cameras, they all use a camera body with a lens attached that captures light via a sensor and then encodes this into a digital file that recreates the image as captured using the camera’s hardware.<br> 
           Some may contend that digital cameras can never capture the same level of fidelity as film, modern cameras and sensors are able to capture incredibly high levels of detail, even in low-light environments where older technology may struggle. In addition to the quality of modern digital cameras, having the ability to use different lens and sensor settings and see your results immediately can often lead to increased skill in capturing images with more complicated hardware. Seeing an image on the fly and making immediate adjustments is often a path toward mastery. <br>
           As a matter of opinion, I find the ease of access to digital cameras to be the most valuable aspect of this medium. Since almost all of us are carrying around a smartphone daily that has a built-in camera, having the opportunity to capture images of spontaneous moments always can lead to preserved memories that wouldn’t always be possible in an era of film-only cameras. While not always the best camera for a given job, they say the best camera is the one you have on you, and digital cameras make photography more accessible than ever before. 
        </p>
        <h3>Polaroid</h3>
        <p>Polaroid photography is extremely similar to film photography since it also uses a camera and a lens to capture light that is then transferred to film stock, this medium uses a different format of film that develops immediately. This unique film stock has a different structure that includes the chemicals necessary to develop the photograph within minutes of taking a snap with a compatible camera. <br>
           Even though Polaroid photography is far from its peak in popularity, this has seen a slight comeback as younger generations find the unique aesthetic of this film, and the novelty of how it is developed to be a fun way to capture memories in social situations. Unless there is a specific creative directive, this will likely never be the go-to format for professional photography, but the ability to take and nearly immediately see your photos will have an interested audience for as long as companies are willing to produce the film stock needed for these cameras. 
        </p>
		<h3>Smartphone</h3>
        <p>Similarly to how Polaroid photography is so closely related to film photography, smartphone photography is an offshoot of digital. Over the last two decades as we have moved from mobile phones that were primarily used for communication only, our smartphones have become singular devices that can nearly handle all aspects of our daily lives in terms of communication and digital information. This includes photography. <br>
           With smartphones being on our person almost constantly, this has become the most common way for people to capture photos and memories in the modern age. This is true to such an extent that many modern smartphones are being released with two, three, and sometimes even four different lenses to provide the maximum photo capabilities to users. With high quality sensors in our pockets, the proliferation of smartphones has made everyone a photographer to some extent. 
        </p>
		<h3>Drone</h3>
        <p>Drone photography is the newest of the listed photography mediums with the advent of affordable consumer-level drones in the marketplace. There has been a commercial market for this for some time, but even this is still newer. <br>
           With the technology inherent to drones, having cameras attached to a remote device that can be flown opens a wide range of uses for high quality cameras including commercial property development, advertisements, content creation, and even unique family portraits. Ranging from consumer to professional grade, there are a wide variety of drones available that allow hobbyists to pros to take their passions to the sky to navigate a flying camera to new heights not possible before which enables them to capture unique photos and videos.

        <h2>Popular Photography Genres</h2>
		<h3>Portrait</h3>
        <p>Portrait photography involves capturing closer images that are primarily of subjects faces, and sometimes torso. This can be for an individual, or a group of people, but regardless of group size it is meant to capture the person as the main subject with less attention paid to the background of extra elements. <br>
           Portraits can be for professional purposes such as artists’ headshots, or LinkedIn profiles, but can also be taken as keepsakes for family memories. While usually meant to be more professional, there is certainly room for flexibility when capturing portraits where photographers can add artistic flourishes as long as the subject is okay with taking that direction. 
         </p>
        <h3>Landscape</h3>
        <p>Similarly to portrait photography, landscape photography can be taken on a variety of mediums or formats but uses natural beauty and structures as the subject. Given the wide variety of ecosystems and landscapes available around the world, landscape photography is one of a great variety in terms of subject and styles. 
        </p>
        <h3>Street</h3>
        <p>Street Photography is the most accessible of these types of photography as it only requires a camera, and a public space you can move through capturing photos of individuals in their daily lives. This photography genre involves capturing mostly urban spaces, in natural light, and uses a variety of equipment and style types to capture natural life with a photographer’s eye. 
        </p>
		<h3>Commercial</h3>
        <p>Commercial photography is any instance of a photographer capturing photos for a paid client that means to use these for a business or organization. This can be for advertising or promotional purposes, educational purposes, or for branding that will be used in signage or other iconography. <br>
           While there is certainly room for flexibility like the other genres of photography, this is generally the least embellished type and often has more plain styling so as to be neutral for the business owner. 
        </p>
		<h3>Artistic</h3>
        <p>Artistic photography is any use of a camera and capture images to make an artistic expression. This can be more formal in aesthetics and appear to be a portrait, or can be an abstract representation of an idea where the subject or object being captured is not immediately recognizable. This has the widest range of styles and applications</p>
